We used the alu_fifo_design.sv from https://github.com/appledore22/ALU_FIFO/blob/master/alu_fifo_design.sv.

In addition, we also consider other designs which are shown below:
1. https://github.com/SumaiyaTariqueLabiba/SystemVerilog-Basics
2. https://github.com/snbk001/Verilog-Design-Examples/tree/main

## Instruction to run the code
Run the command: 

```
sh run.sh 
```

Click the green arrow in the top bar (Prove all). You should see every properties being verified, some of them failed but most of them passed.
